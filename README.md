  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

- I have comments to explain my layers (brains.py)
- I had to alter images in dataset to get them to all be 256 x 256 x 3 (alter_images.py)
- I tested my model on test images and calculated its accuracy with every class (classify_tumor.py)
